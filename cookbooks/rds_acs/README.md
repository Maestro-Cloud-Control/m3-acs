## MariaDB is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) that is a compatible drop-in replacement for the widely used MySQL database technology.
*MariaDB is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) that is a compatible drop-in replacement for the widely used MySQL database technology. It was created as a software fork of MySQL by developers who played key roles in building the original database; they devised MariaDB in 2009 in response to Oracle Corp.'s acquisition of MySQL.

MariaDB is based on SQL and supports ACID-style data processing with guaranteed atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability for transactions. Among other features, the database also supports JSON APIs, parallel data replication and multiple storage engines, including InnoDB, MyRocks, Spider, Aria, TokuDB, Cassandra and MariaDB ColumnStore.*
```bash
# testing from localhost; command line used
mysql -u root -p
mysql -u USER_NAME -p DB_NAME

SHOW DATABASES;
```

## MySQL is a relational database management system
*A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. The database structure is organized into physical files optimized for speed.*

```bash
# testing from localhost; command line used
mysql -u root -p

# mysql -u USER_NAME -p DB_NAME
mysql -u admin -p 
mysql -u admin -p admin_db

# SQL
SHOW DATABASES;
```
